# FloraOS TODO

The current, live list of explicitly-open gaps — not a wishlist. Every entry
here is cross-referenced from the code/docs that would otherwise silently gloss
over the gap (this project's own "TODO over silence" rule, see
ARCHITECTURE.md). Deliberate, permanent design choices (e.g. no WM/DE bundled
in the base image, app isolation under `~/apps/`) are *not* listed here — this
file is only for things that could reasonably be finished later.
  **More features for yay-to-fis** – rename it to be more general, add more features the translater so the person transforming the buildfile needs to look less and can trust more. rewrite in another language if that brings more features.
  give the .fis language special attributes so a dev can make their package better for floraos's system
- **No real GPU-accelerated driver** — the kernel only ships a generic
  simpledrm/sysfb KMS driver, not i915/amdgpu/nouveau. Add the one your
  hardware needs once this actually blocks someone (see README.md's
  GUI-readiness note).
- **Persistent syslog daemon** — not scripted, no concrete logging
  requirement has shown up yet. See ARCHITECTURE.md/MANIFEST.md.
- **`fau backup`'s `restore` rename sequence still isn't fully atomic** — a
  crash between the two renames (`mv @ -> @pre-restore-*` and
  `mv @snapshots/<name> -> @`) still leaves `@` briefly missing; the only
  real fix would be a `renameat2(RENAME_EXCHANGE)`-based swap, and no tool
  this project ships exposes that syscall (adding one — a small compiled
  helper, same class as `fauelf` — hasn't been decided as worth it yet for
  this alone). The window is now as narrow as it gets without that, and no
  longer an unrecoverable brick: `fau backup-repair <name>` completes an
  interrupted restore after booting the still-working "FloraOS (backup:
  <name>)" GRUB entry. See ARCHITECTURE.md's fau-backup section.
- **No Secure Boot support in `florainstall`'s new UEFI path** (see
  ARCHITECTURE.md) — no shim, no MOK enrollment, GRUB's own EFI binary is
  unsigned. Machines that enforce Secure Boot (most do by default) need it
  turned off in firmware setup to boot a FloraOS install. Fine today (no
  signed-boot requirement has shown up yet, same reasoning as the syslog
  daemon entry above); a real gap once that changes.
- **Single-user mode (runlevel `S1`) doesn't actually do anything** —
  `/etc/inittab`'s `l1:S1:wait:/usr/bin/openrc single` has no
  `etc/runlevels/single/` services defined, so reaching it today invokes
  neither an emergency shell nor a password prompt of any kind. `sulogin`
  (see ARCHITECTURE.md/MANIFEST.md's sysvinit entry) now exists, correctly
  linked and verified working end-to-end, specifically to be usable here —
  it just isn't wired in yet. Found while restoring `sulogin`, not the
  thing that restoration fixed.

- **`fau setlang`/`fau setkeyboard`** — no locale/keymap switcher exists
  yet. `usr/share/locale` (91 languages' gettext catalogs) and
  `usr/share/i18n` (localedef's source data for every locale) are now
  stripped from the shipped ISO entirely (see fau.md's "Dead-weight strip"
  section) since `LANG` is hardcoded to `en_US.UTF-8` and nothing reads
  them today — but that means there's currently no way to get a different
  language back without rebuilding the ISO by hand. The natural fix reuses
  existing machinery: Arch's own `glibc` package (already fetchable via
  `alpm_resolve`/the alpm fallback `install_one_alpm` already uses) bundles
  the same `usr/share/i18n/{locales,charmaps}` source data — `fau setlang
  <locale>` would fetch it into a throwaway dir (same disposable-sandbox
  pattern as `fau build`), run `localedef` to generate just the requested
  locale into `usr/lib/locale`, and point `/etc/profile`'s `LANG` at it.
  Keymaps are a separate, simpler case: `kbd`'s `usr/share/kbd/keymaps` is
  small (1.3M for every layout) and already fully shipped, unstripped, so
  `fau setkeyboard <layout>` needs no fetch at all — just validate the
  layout exists, call `loadkeys`, and persist the choice into whatever
  config OpenRC's `keymaps` init.d service reads. Not implemented yet.

- **`fau update`'s rolling base-system rebuild now covers all 30
  `MANDATORY_ORDER` packages** — every one has a real
  `fau-recipes/system/*.fis` recipe (see `tools/fau/fau.md` for the full
  list). The last 7 (`rsync`, `openrc`, `eudev`, `curl`, `sysvinit`,
  `glibc`, `linux-lts`) needed real, not guessed, fixes for build-host-only
  assumptions in their original recipes — each spot-verified with an
  actual build, not assumed correct because it parses:
    - **`rsync`/`openrc`**: no build-host-only concept at all, same
      trivial shape as the first 23 converted. Real builds produce a
      working binary reporting the right version.
    - **`eudev`**: pointing `PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR` at the real, installed
      `kmod` (confirmed present at `/usr/lib/pkgconfig` on a built
      system) instead of the build-host-only `$STAGE_DIR` works; a real
      build produces a working `udevadm`.
    - **`curl`**: `--with-mbedtls=/usr` (the real install path) instead
      of `$STAGE_DIR/mbedtls/files/usr`; a real build's `curl` correctly
      reports `mbedTLS/3.6.6` and fetches real HTTPS.
    - **`sysvinit`**: folds the second, correctly-linked `sulogin`
      rebuild (previously inline in `build-rootfs.sh`, against
      `libxcrypt`) directly into `recipe_build` — real build's `sulogin`
      links against the real `libcrypt.so.2`.
    - **`glibc`**: fetches its own kernel source independently and runs
      `headers_install` itself (a live system's own `/usr/include` has
      no `linux/`/`asm/` at all, checked directly, not assumed) — this is
      the package every other rebuild links against, so it got a full
      from-scratch real build, which caught and fixed a real bug:
      `--with-headers` needs `headers_install`'s own `include/` subdir,
      not its parent.
    - **`linux-lts`** (the kernel): the highest-risk package here, and
      the one where real testing caught the most. `floragrub-cfg` already
      writes one GRUB entry per btrfs subvolume, each pointing at that
      subvolume's own `/boot/vmlinuz-floraos`, and `fau update`'s
      unconditional pre-update snapshot gets its own entry before any
      rebuild happens — a frozen snapshot's kernel is untouched by
      whatever happens to the live `@` afterward, so picking that entry
      after a bad rebuild already recovers the old kernel (the same model
      openSUSE's snapper+grub-btrfs uses). `PKG_NEEDS_DISK=1` and
      `PKG_MANUAL_UPDATE=1` (see `tools/fau/fau.md`) mean it refuses on a
      live system and never runs during a bare `fau update` (a real
      kernel rebuild is tens of minutes even parallelized — too slow for
      an unattended everyday update); it only rebuilds when named
      explicitly (`fau update linux-lts`/`fau bootstrap-build linux-lts`).
      A real, deliberately-broken-kernel-and-recover QEMU test found and
      fixed three further real bugs along the way, none of them guessed:
      mbedTLS silently never offering RSA-PSS signature schemes during a
      TLS 1.2 handshake (a genuine upstream mbedTLS limitation, confirmed
      still present in mbedTLS's own development branch, not a
      FloraOS-specific regression — fixed with a source patch in
      `mbedtls.fis`/`mbedtls.sh`, verified against 7 real hosts including
      the one that first exposed it); kbuild's own host tools needing
      `linux/*.h` a live system doesn't have (fixed by pointing
      `HOSTCFLAGS` at the `linux-api-headers` package already
      sandbox-fetched as one of `gcc`'s own build deps, not a
      hand-reconstructed `headers_install` output — that has its own
      chicken-and-egg problem); and `bison` hardcoding both its own data
      directory and the `m4` binary's path to `/usr/...` (fixed via
      `BISON_PKGDATADIR`/`M4`, its own documented overrides).

See ARCHITECTURE.md for the full design-decision history (including
everything above that's already DONE, and the reasoning behind each).
